## Why 2 versions?

Early into this project it was understood that it would be irresponsible to publicly release every single feature that had been achieved internally. If everyone were able to ban everyone from all the rooms, the game would quickly become unplayable.

The private build cannot be purchased. It is given only to developers for development purposes. Currently, only 3 people have access to it.
